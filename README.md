# XNA-Based-Game-Design-Development
 A game using XNA Game Studio 4.0 and Microsoft Visual C Sharp 2010 Express


Our team mainly improved the game in the following aspects:
Firstly,we changed 2 lanes into 4 lanes and also added hazards on each lane uniformly;
Secondly,we added sound support while playing,moreover,we realized vivid sound effect when the car hits a hazard;
Thirdly,we modified the main interface that supports different cars to choose,players can choose any type of car they like in the process of the game;
Fourthly, the players are able to manipulate the car with the ‘left’,‘right’, ’up’ and ‘down’ key rather than ‘space’ key,that is to say,the car can also go forward or go backward,which makes the game more interesting;
Fifthly,besides the hazards,we added LifeBoxs which can add one chance to play once eaten by the car when the number of the remaining cars is less than 3,but it doesn’t take any effect if the number of the remaining cars reach the upper limit; furthermore,to make the game more difficult,we changed 4 chances into 3 chances;
Finally, to make the overall effect better,we modified the color of the hazard,the background,the road and also changed a few pictures.
